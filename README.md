## **Overview**

🔍 As part of a learning initiative, I utilized Bright Data and Cheerio for web scraping e-commerce websites, focusing on extracting and processing dynamic product prices. This project provided hands-on experience in handling real-time data and improved my efficiency in managing and analyzing large datasets.

I engineered a robust backend system to monitor and analyze price fluctuations. This system tracks changes in product prices over time, providing valuable insights into market trends. To enhance user experience, I implemented an email notification system that alerts users when prices for their selected products reach predefined thresholds. This feature ensures that users are promptly informed about significant price changes, allowing them to make informed purchasing decisions.
